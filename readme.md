# Ōkami Speedstuffs

This is, as you can tell at the top left of your screen, a fork of a repo for tools related to Okami speedrunning. FWIW, [here's the original repo](https://github.com/speedfuns/okami).

This repo includes:
- `okami.CT` - [Cheat Engine](https://cheatengine.org) Table for Ōkami on PC  
- `okami.asl` - Autosplitter for [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org) ([Link to their GH, specifically their repo that holds documentation on writing an autosplitter script](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit.AutoSplitters))
